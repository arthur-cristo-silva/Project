# Python-CRUD
Python-CRUD is a user-friendly interface that allows you to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a list of users. It's a straightforward tool for managing user data with ease. This project was created as part of the course "Desenvolvendo um Projeto Completo em Python com Estruturas de Dados" offered by Fundação Bradesco.
